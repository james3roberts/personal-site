          After nearly 30 years in construction, I know that{" "}
          <em>time is money</em> and <em>you get out what you put in</em>. My
          body was my most-used tool — but unlike a power drill, you can’t just
          upgrade it. So I decided to start building in a new way: with a
          keyboard instead of my back.

          To make that change, I earned a four-year computer science degree —
          100% online. The closest program that worked with my schedule was
          2,000 miles away. No classrooms. No one to bail me out when things
          broke. I had to debug problems, manage my time, and figure things out
          solo. That taught me as much as the coursework itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I use those skills to keep doing what I’ve always done: build
          things that help people.

          If you’re a business owner, I want to help you grow — by making you
          easier to find, easier to trust, and easier to hire.

          Got an idea for modernizing a hands-on trade? I want to help bring it
          to life.

          Whether you’re a one-person crew or a ten-person team, I want to help
          you spend less time chasing work and more time doing what you’re best
          at.

          Building homes was always a team effort. Now, I build websites and
          digital tools that support the team behind the tools.
